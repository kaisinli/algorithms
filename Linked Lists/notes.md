# Notes

### Singly linked list
Each node has a pointer pointing to the next node.

### Doubly linked list
Each node has a pointer pointing to the next node and a pointer pointing to the previous node. 

### Why linked lists?
Linked lists has O(n) for read and O(1) for insertion. 

Linked lists have several advantages over arrays. Insertion of an element at a specific point of a list is a constant-time operation, 
whereas insertion in an array may require moving half of the elements, or more.
