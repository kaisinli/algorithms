# Notes

### Singly linked list
Each node has a pointer pointing to the next node.

### Doubly linked list
Each node has a pointer pointing to the next node and a pointer pointing to the previous node. 

### Why linked lists?
Linked lists has O() for reading and O(1) for insertion. However, to get to the point of insertion is O(n). Linked 
lists have several advantages over arrays. Insertion of an element at a specific point of a list is a constant-time operation, 
whereas insertion in an array may require moving half of the elements, or more.
